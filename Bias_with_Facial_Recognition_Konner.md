  Name of your Gear Up Presentation: Bias with Facial Recognition Software 
  
  Talking points for your presentation:
  * Facial recognition technology is improving by leaps and bounds.
  When the person in the photo is a white man, the software is right 99 percent of the time.But the darker the skin, the more   errors arise.
  * Today, facial recognition software is being deployed by companies in various ways, including to help target product
  pitches based on social media profile pictures. But companies are also experimenting with face identification and other A.I.
  technology as an ingredient in automated decisions with higher stakes like hiring and lending.
  * Good of facial recognition - consumer benefits, company benefits, law enforcement good
  * Dangers - potential for abuse with the imperfect technology, particularly with woman of color
  * Case study or two
  
  2-3 discussion questions you might want people to discuss after your presentation:
    1. Who should be responsible for regulating these technologies? Does your answer change with increased use from law
    enforcement? 
    2.If your future company wants to leverage facial recognition for their product, what points will you make sure the team
    knows?
    3. Do the benefits outweigh the cost? In which scenarios is it okay?  If your future company wants to leverage facial
    recognition for their product, what points will you make sure the team knows?
